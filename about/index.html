                        <h1>About</h1>
                        <p>I hold a Ph.D. in computational chemistry and have considerable experience in data science, scientific computing, and project leadership. Throughout my career, I have played key roles in numerous data-intensive projects and have a track record of delivering impactful results. I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights, build robust models, make accurate predictions, and ultimately deepen our understanding of the underlying scientific phenomena. 
                          
                          In my free time, I like to walk, read and do lino printing.
