<div class="about">
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I hold a Ph.D. in computational chemistry and have considerable
                experience in data science, scientific computing, and project leadership.
                I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights,
                build robust models, make accurate predictions, and ultimately
                deepen our understanding of the underlying scientific phenomena.
                Since data engineering is the backbone of successful data-centric
                decision-making, I am currently working on improving my data science
                and engineering abilities. </p>

        <p>In my free time, I like to walk, read and do lino printing.
        </p>
