        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I hold a Ph.D. in computational chemistry and have
                experience in data science, scientific computing, and project leadership. I am passionate about
                leveraging data to uncover insights, building robust models, and making accurate predictions.
                Since data engineering is the backbone of successful data-centric
                decision-making, I am currently working on improving my data science and engineering skills. </p>

        <p>In my free time, I like to walk, read and do lino printing.
