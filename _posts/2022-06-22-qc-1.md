## Computational Chemistry in the Cloud

Computational chemistry means many different tools for different learners. However, one common feature of all the comp chem software is the complexity. This is because the end product results from many years of work by many researchers. Luckily, there are many open-source codes available now. Combine that with free compute resources such as google colab, you can run your own comp chem exercise in no time.

Unfortunately, standard quantum chemistry calculations last too long due to usage limits (12 hours runtime and 16GB memory). But if your system is not too large, you can easily do reasonably good geometry optimizations using the semiempirical methods in the cloud. Recently, I posted a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/saevrenk/qc/blob/main/xtb.ipynb) to show how to use the [xTB semiempirical code](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html) from the Grimme group in the cloud for free. This notebook was inspired by Prof. Jensen's presentation at [here](https://youtu.be/KEIpJ50Jc0w). 

You can use condacolab to setup rdkit and xtb (it takes sometime to install the packages):
```python
%%capture
!pip install -q condacolab
import condacolab
condacolab.install()

!mamba install -c conda-forge rdkit
!mamba install -c conda-forge xtb
!pip install py3Dmol
```
An example geometry optimization for the following PROTAC is shown in the notebook:

```python
protac_smi = 'C[C@@H]1CC2=C(NC3=CC=CC=C23)[C@H](N1CC(C)(C)F)C1=C(F)C=C(OCCOCCOCCOCC(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N2C[C@H](O)C[C@H]2C(=O)NCC2=CC=C(C=C2)C2=C(C)N=CS2)C(C)(C)C)C=C1F'
protac = Chem.MolFromSmiles(protac_smi)
protac
```

Unfortunately 3D geometries do not display properly in the jupyter notebook, but the colab link is also provided which works fine.
