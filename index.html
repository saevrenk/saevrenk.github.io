	Some photosynthetic bacteria have nano-sized antennas called chlorosomes that
	capture light efficiently. In this project, I investigate biomimetic zinc-porphyrin supramolecular
	structures inspired by chlorosomes through atomistic simulations (GROMACS),
	and perform quantum chemical calculations to understand charge transport properties. These studies aim to understand
	the structure-function
	relationships and contribute to the development of new, green, and sustainable solar energy systems.
	Figure shows the construction and MD studies of the nanotubes.

		Zinc-complexed porphyrin and chlorophyll derivatives form functional aggregates
		with remarkable photophysical and optoelectronic properties. Understanding the
		type and strength of intermolecular interactions between these molecules is
		essential for designing new materials with desired morphology and functionality. In this project
		I did a systematic study of the interaction energy (IE) in zinc-porphyrin complexes with
		increasing structural complexity so that the effect of substitutions on the dimer IEs is quantified.
		I used semiempirical, density functional, and symmetry-adapted perturbation methods to find a
		good balance of cost and accuracy. Moreover, the types of intermolecular interactions are
		evaluated using energy decomposition analysis based on the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT).

		Organic semiconductors are an important class of (opto)electronic materials,
		with a wide range of potential applications from photovoltaics to artificial nerves.
		The goal of this project was to enable large-scale screening for high-performance
		organic semiconductors by rapid prediction of reorganization energy
		using machine-learning methods. It was on the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/123/36">cover</a>
		of ACS magazine JPCA.</p>

	<p> The project involved creation of a dataset (a),
		calculation of the reorganization energy with DFT methods (b),
		and prediction of the reorganization energy (c). The reorganization energy
		is depicted as greek Lambda is the target value.</p>

		I curated acompound set of 171, which was derived from known p-type OSCs built from moieties such as
		acenes, thiophenes, and pentalenes and studied the structure-property relationships.
