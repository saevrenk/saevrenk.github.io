			Prediction of reorganization energy using machine learning</a></h2>
	<p>
		Organic semiconductors are an important class of (opto)electronic materials,
		with a wide range of potential applications from photovoltaics to artificial nerves.
		The goal of this project was to enable large-scale screening for high-performance
		organic semiconductors by rapid prediction of reorganization energy
		using machine-learning methods. It was on the <a href:"https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/123/36">cover</a>.
		of ACS magazine JPCA.</p>
	<p> The project involved creation of a dataset (a),
		calculationo of the reorganization energy with DFT methods(b),
		and prediction of the reorganization energy (c). The reorganization energy
		is depicted as greek Lambda is the target value.</p>
