		Organic semiconductors are an important class of (opto)electronic materials,
		with a wide range of potential applications from photovoltaics to artificial nerves.
		The goal of this project was to enable large-scale screening for high-performance
		organic semiconductors by rapid prediction of reorganization energy
		using machine-learning methods. It was on the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/123/36">cover</a>
		of ACS magazine JPCA.</p>

	<p> The project involved creation of a dataset (a),
		calculation of the reorganization energy with DFT methods (b),
		and prediction of the reorganization energy (c). The reorganization energy
		is depicted as greek Lambda is the target value.</p>

		I curated acompound set of 171, which was derived from known p-type OSCs built from moieties such as
		acenes, thiophenes, and pentalenes and studied the structure-property relationships.
		It was highlighted on the themed collection:

	Here is a recent <a href="https://github.com/saevrenk/molecular_scs/blob/main/osc_clustering.ipynb">notebook</a>
	where I explored clustering and
	interactive plotting with molplotly using this dataset.
